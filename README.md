# 💻 Reshmi Thumatti Jawaharlal - Terminal Style Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive **Terminal-Based Portfolio**!  
This project showcases my technical skills, career journey, and contact information through a unique, command-line inspired web experience.

---

## 🚀 About the Project

This portfolio simulates a command-line terminal environment where visitors can explore my:
- Professional background
- Technical skills
- Major projects
- Contact information

Instead of traditional clicking, users interact by typing simple commands like `about`, `skills`, `projects`, and `contact`.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

I wanted to create a portfolio that reflects my **backend engineering** and **cloud development** background while offering something **different** from regular landing-page portfolios.

This design highlights:
- A developer's environment (Terminal)
- Interactivity and creativity
- Clean and minimal aesthetic in dark mode

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Dark theme + animations)
- Vanilla JavaScript (command parsing, dynamic rendering)
- Animate On Scroll (AOS) Library (optional for smooth animations)
